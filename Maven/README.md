# Understanding the Building Process and Build Tools

## 1. What is a Building Process?

The building process in software development involves several key steps:

### Source Code

- Code written in languages like Java, .NET, etc.

### Compile

- Compilation of source code using tools like `javac`.

### Test

- Execution of unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

### Package

- Packaging the compiled code into distributable formats such as JAR, WAR, EXE, MSI, ZIP, etc.

### Health Checks

- Code analysis and bug detection to ensure the overall health of the codebase.

## 2. Build Tools

There are various build tools available to facilitate the building process:

- **Maven:** Primarily for Java projects and uses XML format for configuration.
- **ANT:** A Java-based build tool.
- **MSBuild:** Microsoft's build platform.
- **Gradle:** Uses Groovy for configuration.
- **NANT:** .NET build tool.
- **Make:** A build tool for managing dependencies.

## 3. Maven Phases

Maven, a popular build tool for Java projects, operates in distinct phases:

1. **Validate:**
   - Ensures the project is correct and has all necessary information.

2. **Compile:**
   - Compiles the source code.

3. **Test:**
   - Executes unit tests without requiring code packaging or deployment.

4. **Package:**
   - Packages the compiled code into distributable formats (e.g., JAR).

5. **Verify:**
   - Runs checks on integration test results to ensure quality criteria are met.

6. **Install:**
   - Installs the package into the local repository for local project dependencies.

7. **Deploy:**
   - Copies the final package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
